/* opium_arena.c 
 *
 * There is no need to write anything special on top of the slab.
 * The whole point of the arena is that it:
 *
 * - Distribues the load access sets of slabs (16, 32, 64 ... bytes etc.)
 * - Knows the rules for choosing the right slab (via round of two and log)
 * - Saves the slab index in the slab header (so it can be freed later without a lookup)
 *
 * It doesn`t need any more logic (for allocation/free);
 * everything else is already hidden is the slab
 *

    *
    * - Each slab can only work with fixed sizes: 16, 32, 64, etc bytes. 
    * - In a real program, arbitrary sizes are often needed.
    * Arena combines a set of slabs and automatically selects the appropriate
    * slab for any request.
    *
    * This approach:
    * 1) Avoids code duplication (slab already manages pages, slots and bitmask)
    * 2) Allows for quick memory for different sizes.
    * 3) Simplifies statistics and logging - are sees all slabs at once.
    *
    * Idea: slab = building block, arena = manager of the entire structure.
